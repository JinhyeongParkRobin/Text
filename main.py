1. Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
2. experimental, human, and random error
4.In other languages, however, I've seen cases both where it doesn't matter (in JavaScript, both 'hi'=="hi" and 'hi'==="hi" return true) and where it does (in C#, "d" is a string while 'd' is a char)
5.A string is a palindrome when it is the same
when read backwards.
For example:
the string "bob" is a palindrome So is "abba".
But the string "abcd" is not a palindrome, because "abcd" != "dcba".5.
